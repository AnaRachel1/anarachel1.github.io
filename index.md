[Music Genre Classification](https://github.com/anarachel1/Music-Genre-Classification-CNN)
<br> An use of convulational neural network for music genre classification. There is also a simple example using an artificial neural network for the same goal. These Models were trained using the GTZAN Dataset which contains songs from 10 different genres.

## ML projects

[Linear regression is that simple?](http://example.com/)
Linear regressions are very common and considered simple algorithms. We have created familiarity with it since high school, but there are some details that must be observed for the model to present consistent results that a few people pay attention to. It is also important to understand what actions to take if our model overfitts the date. Let's talk about it.
