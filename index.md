## Audio Signal Analysis

**[Audio Signals Study](/audio_study)**
<br> Initial studies about audio (song) processing, talks about audio features and representations.
<br> *Figure - Audio representations for the song Perfect by Ed Sheeran.*

> [Understanding audio data jupter notebook](https://github.com/anarachel1/Studying-audio-signals) <br> Practical material with above concepts and applications, one of them recognition of repetitive patterns in songs. 

<br>

**[Music Genre Classification Project](https://github.com/anarachel1/Music-Genre-Classification-CNN)**
<br> An use of convulational neural network for music genre classification. There is also a simple example using an artificial neural network for the same goal. These Models were trained using the GTZAN Dataset which contains songs from 10 different genres.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

**[Simple Linear Regression is that simple?](/regression.md)**
<br> Linear regressions are very common in machine learning problems and are considered simple algorithms. The familiarity with the term is created from high school, but there are some details that must be observed for the model to present consistent results that a few people pay attention to. Another important topic when talking about regression models is overfitting, thus it is necessary to understand what actions should be taken to help the model to generalize predictions.
